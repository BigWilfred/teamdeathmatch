# About the Project 
Note: All the research done for this project can be found on the team’s wiki pages on Github. User testing results and procedures that highly affected our iterations can also be found on our wiki pages. 
 
## The Problem
Despite a huge influx of mobile users reading news daily on their phones, often during their daily commute on public transport, people are still required to scroll through news websites and apps to find what they want to read. Opening up news stories one by one is a time consuming and annoying process when you’re trying to find something interesting to read. Some users are inconvenienced by the nature of the design on these sites, for example, sports news are typically featured only at the very bottom of the news app’s front page. Though such readily available mobile news has been a great push in the right direction, these apps are as impersonal as a newspaper. They display what they think you’ll want to read, but really you probably tend to read the same sections and look for the same types of articles as you normally do.
Bulletin has been designed specifically to cater to the issues with the current state of mobile news that have been outlined above, and seeks to provide people with an alternative way to consume news that is all about them rather than about the big media outlets. The app aims to have news quickly and easily consumable for users out and about who may not have access to traditional forms of news, particularly commuters. Unlike other news applications in the market, Bulletin allows users to see what news their friends shared on their ‘News Board’ for the past 24 hours. Our app delivers personalized news right to your phone and will enable users to access the content at any time of the day. It utilises all the features of a mobile application, including push notifications, easy sharing options, and opportunities to connect with their friends and contacts.
 
## The Solution
 
## The Audience
Bulletin is the perfect application for daily commuters who already use their time to check up on the latest news. Being able to select a specific amount of time means they can get the perfectly curated list of videos delivered straight to their phone to match their preferences and their commute time. <br>

However, Bulletin can be used by anyone at any time, not just commuters. The app aggregate and display news from a number of different media outlets, so it is guaranteed to have content anyone would be interested in. Users are also allowed to add their friend’s playlist to their own playlist. Setting up preferences for media outlets and category preferences will allow our users to customise their experience even further.
 
# Idea Progression Iterations 
Iteration 1: <br>
The initial idea which the team had planned to be developed was selected from a pool of all the ideas students had come up with in the class. It was aiming to answer the question of ‘How might we make the news more quickly accessible and easily consumable for mobile users on the go who just want a quick update?’. It was inspired by a number of other applications out there which were not specifically in the journalism space like Snapchat and Soundcloud. It would allow users to quickly swipe through short news videos with the ability to like or dislike videos to influence content displayed to them in the future. <br>
The original poster of the idea can be seen below: <br>

Very quickly the team realised that although the concept seemed promising, there were a number of aspects in the idea which when considered further did not appear to be feasible or logical given the audience we were aiming for. We decided that the idea was too similar to other applications and did not offer anything exciting, new or innovative in the space of news, it was more of a response to problems with other applications rather than a new idea of our own. <br>

Ultimately, we learned a lot from this first iteration, primarily in the form of getting a clearer understanding of the demographics, use cases, and motivations which we were attempting to target. We also gave ourselves a bit of a push to come up with a better idea building on the pros of this first idea. <br>

Idea/Iteration 2: <br>
The second iteration of our idea still had a lot of features carried over from the first version, but we decided to design our application to focus on a different target audience, commuters. We all had expressed observations we had made about our own habits and the habits of those around us on our daily trips to university, and found that a lot of people were spending their time browsing news. We realised that most people will make the same commute to and from work every day, meaning that they always have a specific amount of time in their day with which we could target our app. This element of time was particularly important for us, so we decided to work in an option to select the amount of time you had and let the app build the playlist of videos around that. <br>

Below you can see a few examples of brainstorming and initial mock ups: <br>
 

Moving forward, we decided that pursuing the commuter market was our best opportunity, and one which could be fairly easily tapped into. There are a lot of competitors in the form of news aggregators, especially personalised ones, but nothing that captivated the video news market. We still had a number of things to work out in terms of incorporating a social aspect into this idea, but it presented itself as the strongest one moving forward. <br>

We also wanted expand our target audience to commuters who drive to work daily. We figured that we could deliver similar content to these users in a hands free audio version, and still largely achieve the same effect. The user interface would need to be very different as we would not want to encourage people to be tapping and swiping on their phones whilst driving, however, we saw a simple solution to this in using an audio driven version of the application. Potentially including voice or Bluetooth controls, users would be able to substitute listening to the news on the radio for listening to a curated playlist of the latest news delivered directly to their phone. <br>
