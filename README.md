## Introduction
The project that will be undertaken over the course of the semester in DECO3500 involves generating a new idea that addresses an existing issue or dilemma in the domain of news or journalism. The project will be developed utilising social, mobile and web technologies in order to explore how the dilemma can be resolved and to create a proof of concept prototype. More specifically, the dilemma the team has chosen to address is how might we make news more quickly and easily consumable for users on the go? Our goal is to prototype and build a mobile application that addresses this dilemma with a viable, appealing and engaging design that is capable of making a real impact in the news domain.

## Concept
The project our team has proposed centres around the issue of people on the go (or with very little time) not having a quick and easy way to consume the latest news. Current news applications require users to scroll through headlines and open up stories they are interested in one by one. Even in this case, some users are inconvenienced more than others based on their interests. For example, sports news is typically featured only at the very bottom of the news applications’ front pages. Below are a few examples of current news applications, and their convoluted scrolling based deliveries:

In the same way short news bulletins aired on TV at the start of prime-time give people a quick update on recent news in a short and easily consumable format, the proposed application would provide people with up to date news in the form of short video snippets they could access on their mobile devices. 

The application draws inspiration from a number of social media sites and other applications, combining them into a new platform for consuming news in video form. Taking from the idea of Snapchat stories being short snippets arranged chronologically to create a narrative, our application would employ a similar technique to keep users engaged and deliver the most interesting and relevant content in a short period of time. The application will also implement similar functionalities such as quickly tapping or swiping through news stories, and categorising content based on locations or topics. 

Another core feature the application is giving the users an option to select a specific amount of time they have free, and letting the application create a playlist feed for them based on how much time they specify. This is particularly useful for users on the go as they may be trying to catch up on news during their lunch break or commute. Users will be able to select a time amount between 2 and 15 minutes, which will populate their feed accordingly. 

The news being delivered to users will be in the form of video snippets grabbed from various reputable sources, and will primarily consist of news videos that have been released since the user last checked the application. A user’s feed would be curated based on his or her interests, what’s currently trending, and important breaking news, with the option to re-tailor the content delivered to you at any time.

As users watch the video snippets, they will be presented with options to save or bookmark the original source of the video to a list of external links which they can access for more information at a later point where they may have more time. Users will also be able to post the original source of the video to their social media sites, directly from inside the application.

The application differs from other current news platforms both in the way the content is curated and how users can interact with it. Delivering short form news videos from various places to users whilst they’re out and about who otherwise may not have the time to read up on the news until they arrive home is a very appealing problem space, and one which no single application has been able to address fully yet. 

###Walkthrough:

- The user opens the application on their phone, and logs into their account if they haven’t already.

- The user is then prompted to either select the amount of time they have available or simply choose to browse at their own leisure. The user can select anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes.

- If the user chooses to set a specific length of time, then they will also have the option to select/deselect topics for inclusion in their feed. For example, the user may only be interested in seeing sports news if they know a recent game has happened, but not at other times.

- Taking the selected time length and chosen interests, as well as utilising other information such as location and previous likes/dislikes, the application will compile a playlist or queue for the user of short video news snippets.

- The user will be able to see the playlist, and optionally re-order it by dragging titles up or down before they begin watching.

- Once they begin watching, they will be able to quickly swipe through the videos as well as fast-forward each video.

- For each video, the user will have the option to like/dislike videos to influence what is shown to them in the future.

- The user will also be able to save or bookmark videos, which will add the original article or news video to a list of external links they want to read later when they have more time.


###Future Features:

A potential future feature of the application may be displaying timed comments, similar to Soundcloud, which would pop up throughout the news videos. Allowing people to comment on specific sections of news reports would be useful primarily for allowing users to discuss certain things said at certain points of the videos. Users would also be able to fact check with other users, and provide their opinions directly when and where they thought of them. Although we believe this feature could be an asset to the overall usefulness of the application, it has potential to overcomplicate the efficiency and streamlined nature of the application which is the primary focus. The benefits and downfalls of including this feature will be explored and developed further if time permits.

### Conflict Resolution
*If a conflict or dispute arises, the team has decided that a voting system to resolve issues will be put in place. A majority vote will be conducted to select the most appropriate idea, or a compromise determined by the majority of the team will be settled if the vote is drawn.  
*Underperformers who are able to show cause will be given special consideration, and are responsible for discussing with the group how they intend to rectify the situation. Members who underperform due to a lack of understanding will be given a chance to seek further coaching and help after providing the group with a time frame for completion.  
*If any group member fails to meet the deadline for submission of their assignment tasks, it is the duty of the team leader to follow up with the team member by contacting and asking the reason for the delay, expecting a reply within 48 hours.  
*If the team member is able to show cause for failure, their work would be redistributed among team members. Otherwise, said team member would be given a warning and provided with 48 hours to complete the work before the issue is brought to teaching staff.  
*If a member breaches the group contract, the following will take place:  
  1.In the first instance contact will be made to the particular group member outlining the issues or area that’s lacking. They will be given 48 hours to respond in defence.  
  2.In the second instance a group meeting will be held to address the issue where all parties can present their arguments and the group will decide an outcome.    
  3.In the third instance, an email will be sent to the offender, the lecturer and tutor/s addressing this issue. If all efforts fail, the team will undergo Peer Assessment.
