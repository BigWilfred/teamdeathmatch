### Conflict Resolution
*If a conflict or dispute arises, the team has decided that a voting system to resolve issues will be put in place. A majority vote will be conducted to select the most appropriate idea, or a compromise determined by the majority of the team will be settled if the vote is drawn.
*Underperformers who are able to show cause will be given special consideration, and are responsible for discussing with the group how they intend to rectify the situation. Members who underperform due to a lack of understanding will be given a chance to seek further coaching and help after providing the group with a time frame for completion.
*If any group member fails to meet the deadline for submission of their assignment tasks, it is the duty of the team leader to follow up with the team member by contacting and asking the reason for the delay, expecting a reply within 48 hours.
*If the team member is able to show cause for failure, their work would be redistributed among team members. Otherwise, said team member would be given a warning and provided with 48 hours to complete the work before the issue is brought to teaching staff.
*If a member breaches the group contract, the following will take place:
  1.In the first instance contact will be made to the particular group member outlining the issues or area thatâ€™s lacking. They will be given 48 hours to respond in defence.
  2.In the second instance a group meeting will be held to address the issue where all parties can present their arguments and the group will decide an outcome.  
  3.In the third instance, an email will be sent to the offender, the lecturer and tutor/s addressing this issue. If all efforts fail, the team will undergo Peer Assessment.
